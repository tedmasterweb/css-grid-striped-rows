# css-grid-striped-rows
This is an example of how to add a grey background to every other row in a css grid layout - this does not use tablesâ€¦

In other words, if you have a series of elements and you are using CSS Grid to lay them out in a table display, you can add a grey background to every other row.

The only caveat is that the number of columns must be static.
